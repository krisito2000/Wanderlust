## Usage Examples & API Documentation

This project doesn't have a specific API. It primarily uses HTML and CSS to display content.

**HTML Structure:**

Each HTML file (`index.html`, `destinations.html`, `stories.html`, `contact.html`) follows a similar structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Page Title</title>
  <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <!-- Bootstrap Icons -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.2/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
  <!-- Custom CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Page Content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

**CSS Styling:**

The `css/styles.css` file contains custom CSS rules to override or extend Bootstrap's default styles.  The provided snippet indicates it handles responsiveness with media queries.
